# Desmos-Graph-Animation

How to use Image to Graph:
- Run main.py
- Pick the image you want
- It will take some time, there should be a latex.txt as a result
- Copy and paste the latex.txt content to Desmos Graphing Calculator (just select all and copy, then paste on to the first equation on Desmos)

Graphs an animation onto Desmos
- Desmos is a graphing calculator
- Potrace is a software that turns edges into beizer lines
- Beizer curves are PROBABLY just equations which follow a set of rules. IDK
- And finally, Python is cool

Steps to do:
- Get the animation ✅
- Turn video to images per frame ✅
- Turn those images to BW ✅
- Get the edges using canny edge ✅
- Trace the lines with Potrace✅
- Get the equations from Potrace✅
- Draw the hundreds of equation to Desmos✅
- But wait, you gotta know how to graph onto Desmos first. So, use Desmos API to use it on your own web
- Voila! You got yourself a subpar graph animation

For obvious reasons, I will not be uploading the image sequence, or the video here. The video will probably be on youtube.
