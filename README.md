# Desmos-Graph-Animation
Graphs an animation onto Desmos
- Desmos is a graphing calculator
- Potrace is a software that turns edges into beizer lines
- Beizer curves are PROBABLY just equations which follow a set of rules. IDK.

Steps to do:
- Get the animation
- Turn video to images per frame
- Turn those images to BW
- Trace the lines with Potrace
- Get the equations from Portrace
- Draw the hundreds of equation to Desmos
- Voila! You got yourself a subpar graph animation
