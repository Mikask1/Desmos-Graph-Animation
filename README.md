# Desmos-Graph-Animation
FINISHED

This branch only graphs an image

How to use:
- Run main.py
- Pick the image you want
- It will take some time, there should be a latex.txt as a result
- Copy and paste the latex.txt content to Desmos Graphing Calculator (just select all and copy, then paste on to the first equation on Desmos)

Graphs an image onto Desmos
- Desmos is a graphing calculator
- Potrace is a software that turns edges into beizer lines
- Beizer curves are PROBABLY just equations which follow a set of rules. IDK
- And finally, Python is cool

For obvious reasons, I will not be uploading the image sequence, or the video here. The video will probably be on youtube.
