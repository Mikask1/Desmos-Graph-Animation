# Desmos-Graph-Animation
This branch only graphs an image

Graphs an image onto Desmos
- Desmos is a graphing calculator
- Potrace is a software that turns edges into beizer lines
- Beizer curves are PROBABLY just equations which follow a set of rules. IDK
- And finally, Python is cool

For obvious reasons, I will not be uploading the image sequence, or the video here. The video will probably be on youtube.
